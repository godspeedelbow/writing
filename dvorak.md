Three clickbait reasons why I quit Dvorak
==============================================================

Before I started writing my master thesis back in 2010 I decided to switch to the Dvorak keyboard layout. I read [something](https://ma.tt/2003/08/on-the-dvorak-keyboard-layout/) on it, and it seemed (and indeed, was - I had ample time) a great moment to start typing Dvorak. Now seven years later, I've switched back to Qwerty: the benefits don't justify the hassle anymore.

The premise of Dvorak is that it is an efficient keyboard layout. Keys are positioned in such a way that when you rest your fingers on the keyboard (the home bar), the letters you use most are right under your finger tips (left hand: `A`, `O`, `E`, `U`, `I` and right hand: `D`, `H`, `T`, `N`, `S`). This makes typing more comfortable because your fingers have to move around the keyboard ('finger travel') as little as possible. As an engineer with RSI issues, I found this a compelling argument ([although it's debatable](http://xahlee.info/kbd/myth_of_qwerty_dvorak_layout.html)).

*Qwerty vs Dvorak heat map. The home bar is the row of keys between CAPS LOCK key and the Enter/return key. As you can see, on Dvorak the most common vowels are under your left hand and the most common consonants under your right hand (image courtesy of xahlee.info).*

Another upside is that because popular vowels and consonants are on separate sides of the keyboard, you end up typing alternating between your left and right hand, which is more comfortable and faster than typing entire words with a single hand. This benefit is less prevalent in Dutch because words often contain longer **v**owel and **c**onsonant combinations, e.g. 'schreeuw' (**ccccvvvc**) vs 'scream' (**cccvvc**).

After about one year on Dvorak I was typing faster than I did earlier on Qwerty. Plus, I was now a Cool Personâ„¢. Feeling cool however, has not made up for downsides of typing Dvorak. Here's why I switched back to Qwerty.

1. Keyboard shortcuts are detours
----------------------------------

Keyboard shortcuts are important to me. Whenever I have to use the mouse a lot, my hand, arm and shoulder tire quickly and start hurting eventually. Shortcuts (e.g. `cmd + S` to save a document) allow me to keep my hands on the keyboard, which makes me more productive and reduces my RSI issues. Win, win.

Keyboard shortcuts are often bound to a letter that makes sense semantically: `S` for save, `C` for copy, `Q` for quit. There's also a logic to the location of shortcuts. Right under your left hand are the most common shortcuts: undo/redo (`Z`), cut (`X`), copy (`C`) and paste (`V`). This leaves your right hand free to use the arrow keys or mouse. Very handy when you do a lot of coding.

The Dvorak was invented before shortcuts and is downright unhandy when it comes to common shortcuts. Not only are `Z`, `X`, `C` and `V` all over the place, they are also on the right (wrong) side of the keyboard. This makes it impossible to use these shortcuts with your left whilst at the same time using the mouse or arrow keys with your right hand.

The opposite is also true: _uncommon_ shortcuts are easily accessible. Both `W` and `Q` are located immediately above the left and right `cmd` keys. If I accidentally strike the `W` or `Q` key a bit too low, I also accidentally strike the `cmd` key, resulting either in a closed window (`cmd + W`) or worse, a closed application (`cmd + Q`).

2. Dvorak is useless on smartphones
-----------------------------------

The big benefit of Dvorak - less finger travel because all the common letters are closer to each other - is truly a non-issue when typing on a phone as my fingers will not travel more than an inch anyway. More importantly, compared to Qwerty, writing with Dvorak is significantly harder on a phone - exactly for the same reasons as why it is more efficient on a physical keyboard. Here's why.

When you type on your smart phone, it tries to make sense of what your typing. Because your fingers are bigger than the keys on your phone's keyboard, the touch area of your finger on the screen often contains multiple keys. It's your phone's job to figure out which key you actually intended to type.

All keyboards suffer from this problem but it's much worse with Dvorak. Because all the common letters are right next to each other, the number of possible words for a certain typing pattern can get huge. For added complexity, I regularly write in three different languages: English, Dutch and Swedish, often in the same single sentence. A simple typing pattern of three key strokes could be interpreted as many different words in each language.

For example, the following words are entirely possible alternatives when trying to type 'hot' in Dvorak on my smartphone (for simplification I only wrote down words with letters that are right next to `h`, `o` and `t`):

Grammatically correct interpretations for 'hot' in Qwerty:
git
hit, hor
jot, joy

Grammatically correct interpretations for 'hot' in Dvorak:
dat, dan, doh, dot, don, det, den
hah, hat, han, hon, heh, het, hen
tat, tan, tot, ton, ten

On a Qwerty keyboard you of course also have this problem (5 alternatives) but too a much lesser extent than Dvorak (19 alternatives) because the common letters are more spread out over the keyboard - which makes prediction at lot easier.

Arguably, the longer the word is the less alternative interpretations there are. However, Dvorak with auto-correction turned on was so annoying on my phone (it kept guessing wrong), I quickly switched back to Qwerty (yes, I have been typing with two different layouts for the last five years).

3. You need custom keyboards
----------------------------

It's pretty easy to map your physical Qwerty keyboard to Dvorak in your Operation System's settings. It works well when you touch type but when you have to look down at your keyboard to type (for example because you only have one hand free to type), it gets pretty annoying. Looking at a Qwerty keyboard while typing Dvorak is a real mapping challenge. I type 'Ddpvd' to type my own name 'Eelke', 'bodavya;k' for 'breakfast' and 'Kjd Ldkjdopalh;' becomes 'The Netherlands'.

So, I decided to I switch the _physical_ keys around on both my MacBook and my extra keyboard. Wiggling off keys from your keyboard not only feels scary and risky, it actually is! I have so far destroyed two keyboards, even though I was really trying to be careful.

On the upside, when finished with your keyboard make over, all the keys make sense again! For you, that is as nobody else but you will attempt to use it (there are those who try, get burned and exclaim, 'wtf is this?!' as if their Right To Type had just been revoked). If my MacBook were ever stolen, it would have probably been tossed away because switching those darned keys back is too much hassle - even for a petty thief.

A downside however, is that you no longer have the small bearing lines of the `F` and `J` keys on the right place. This sounds like a minor thing but without it really requires you to sit exactly in front of your keyboard. I don't know how many times I've had to retype a password before realizing I had panned my entire left hand one key to the right.

4. All the minor other issues
-----------------------------

And then there's a bunch of other issues that I ran into.
- You suck at Qwerty. Although you do most typing on your own devices, you sometimes have to use Qwerty on other devices. It's quite confronting to be so painfully slow.
- Whenever you need to use somebody else's computer, you either struggle along with Qwerty or just quickly setup the Dvorak layout on their computer. Sometimes you would forget to switch it back to Qwerty when you're done, locking out the owner. One time, the login screen on my friend's computer was stuck in Dvorak (without any option to switch it back to Qwerty). To solve it, I had to figure out how to type his password in Dvorak layout on a Qwerty keyboard - a sad day for password security.
- For some reason, Apple decided to pivot the orientation of the butterfly mechanism (which pushes back the key upward after being pressed) below the `F` and `J` keys 90 degrees. After I swapped my Qwerty keyboard to Dvorak, I ended up with four keys in an 90 degrees angle (clockwise, if you're interested) - making the appearance of it look even more funky.
- In my editor of choice (Atom), I couldn't use `cmd + shift + Z` as a redo shortcut because of the way keys are bound in Atom/Electron. Instead I had to use `cmd + Y`, which annoyed me plenty because it is at the top of the keyboard, requiring me to use both hands to undo the undone.
- I want to learn vim and that doesn't make sense if all the keys are in a different location. Sure, it's possible to get a keyboard mapping so that everything is in the same place as on a Qwerty layout. However, every time you read or hear anywhere about vim, it's going to be based on Qwerty - the thought of having to mentally map Qwerty vim to Dvorak vim already made me give up vim altogether (now I actually plan to learn it, I already started on [Vim Adventures](https://vim-adventures.com) and this [vim-inpsired](http://kakoune.org/why-kakoune/why-kakoune.html) editor got me really enthusiastic).

In conclusion
-------------

I have switched back. I wrote this article in Qwerty and these last paragraphs went pretty smooth, I'm happy to say. Dvorak has benefits. I've already noticed that normal writing (not coding) is more natural on Dvorak. But I do much more than that with my keyboard - it's an input device through which I perform all kinds of activities, not just writing emails and blog posts. Being a coder, my productivity depends on my tooling and Dvorak was just holding me back.

Goodbye Dvorak, it was great knowing you.
