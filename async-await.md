# Wait up for `async/await`, it's great!

`async/await` is a new javascript feature that allows you to wrap asynchronous code, so it appears to be synchronous. This makes your code easier to read and easier to reason about.

*asynchronicity with callbacks:*
```js
getUser(userId, (err, user) => {
  if (err) return console.error('error', err);
  console.log('user', user);
});
```

*asynchronicity with Promises:*
```js
getUserPromise(userId)
  .then(user => console.log('user', user));
  .catch(err => console.error('error', err));
```

*asynchronicity with Promises plus async/await:*
```js
const user = await getUserPromise(userId); // 'await' the Promise to resolve and assign result to `user`
console.log('user', user);
```

The `await` keyword 'halts' the code execution cursor until the Promise is resolved. As you don't need to use callback functions anymore to deal with asynchronicity, you can now write your code _as if all operations are synchronous_ which is A Good Thingâ„¢:

- **'synchronous' (downward) execution** is easier to read and therefore comprehend
- **no callback functions** means less boiler plate and less indentation
- a **single, shared function scope** removes the need to 'pass data around' - _it's just there_

## A trivial example

The power of `async/await` truly shines in situations where there are multiple asynchronous operations that need to be composed in to a single result.

Consider the following functionality:
- fetch a user and their posts (in parallel, to speed up execution)
- get the comments on those posts
- parse the posts with the comments

You can implement the above functionality with `async/await` quite elegantly as follows.

### Promises, using async-await

```js
const run = async userId => {
  const [user, posts] = await Promise.all([
    getUser(userId),
    getPosts(userId),
  ]);
  // user and post are now available in scope
  const comments = await getComments(posts);
  return await parsePostsWithComments(user, posts, comments);
}

try {
  console.log('postsWithComments', run(userId);
} catch (err) {
  console.log('err', err);
}
```

**Note:**
- whenever you use `await`, the surrounding function needs to be declared to be `async`
- use `try/catch` to handle any Promise that fails within the `async` function

Looks quite neat, huh? Easy to read and easy to reason about! Now consider how this code would look if you don't use `async/await`.

### Promises, without async/await

```js
const run = (userId) => {
  Promise.all([
    getUser(userId),
    getPosts(userId),
  ]).then([user, posts, comments] => {
    getComments(posts).then(comments => {
      parsePostsWithComments(user, posts, comments).then(postsWithComments => {
        console.log('postsWithComments', postsWithComments);
      });
    });
  }).catch(err => {
    console.log('err', err);
  });
}
```

**Note:**
- there's a need for nested Promises because earlier data (e.g. `user`) needs to be accessible to be used later (i.e. when logging it)
- you can also store data in the function scope of `run`. Then you don't need to nest Promises, as they all have access to the data via the function scope of `run`. You can also use a Promise library to store the data on a context object so that it is available in subsequent Promises (usually via `this`). However, both solutions don't scale well as functionality increases in complexity

### callbacks with [`async` module](http://caolan.github.io/async/)

```js
const run = (userId) => {
  async.waterfall([
    callback => {
      async.parallel([
        cb => getUser(userId, cb),
        cb => getPosts(userId, cb),
      ], callback);
    },
    ([user, posts], callback) => {
      getComments(posts, (err, comments) => callback(err, user, posts, comments));
    },
    (user, posts, comments, callback) => {
      parsePostsWithComments(user, posts, comments, callback);
    },
  ], (err, postsWithComments) => {
    if (err) {
      console.log('err', err);
    } else
      console.log('postsWithComments', postsWithComments);
  });
}
```

**Note:**
- 'passing along data' is cumbersome and so is error-handling (`if (err) return done(err);` much lately?)
- there are other control flow libraries that offer similar solutions
- you could also decide to keep data you need later in the function scope of `run` instead of passing it along in each step of the waterfall. However, this is harder to maintain when complexity increases

### Mere callbacks

```js
const run = (userId) => {
  let user;
  let posts;

  getUser(user, (err, _user) => {
    if (err) return done(err);
    user = _user;
    if (posts) pleaseContinue(); // `posts` already fetched? continue
  });
  getPosts(posts, (err, _posts) => {
    if (err) return done(err);
    posts = _posts;
    if (user) pleaseContinue(); // `user` already fetched? continue
  });

  const pleaseContinue = () => {
    getComments(posts, (err, comments) => {
      if (err) return done(err);

      parsePostsWithComments(user, posts, comments, done);
    });
  }
}

const done = (err, postsWithComments) => {
  if (err) {
    console.log('err', err);
  } else
    console.log('postsWithComments', postsWithComments);
  }
};
```

**Note:**
- getting `getUser` and `getPosts` to execute in parallel, is pretty ugly without a proper abstraction like [`async`](http://caolan.github.io/async/)

## Why wait?

With `async/await`, you can write code that is easier to read and reason about. It's native Javascript so it's a matter of time before it's widely supported. To start using it today, use node 7 with `--harmony`. It's also [supported by Chrome](https://twitter.com/addyosmani/status/789126892402204673) and in any case, you can always use `babel` to transpile it into regular ol' javascript.
